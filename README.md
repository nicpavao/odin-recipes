TOP HTML Project

This is a simple HTML project to become more familiar with front-end programming
Based on the project description, we're just going to build a index.html file for
the webpage landing site, and add in a few href links to some recipes.

I imagine we'll make the recipes relative links -- but maybe we'll get creative
and add some absolute links in as well where the user can navigate away to an 
external site.
